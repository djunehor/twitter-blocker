<p class="lead">Welcome to {{app_name}}. You're here because you intend to use the blocker app but the app needs you to authorise it first.</p>
<div class="hero-unit">
	<p>To get started, we'll need you to authorize {{app_name}} to access your Twitter account. More information on what is
		required is available from Twitter's <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/oauth">OAuth</a>
		overview.</p>

	<p>In order to avoid posting too many tweets (and hence banning), please note that the bot will not reply if:
	<ul>
	<li>The tweet replied was by @TweepBlocker i.e you can't use the bot to block the bot</li>
	<li>You didn't reply any tweet or tweet has been deleted as at when bot responds to you.</li>
	<li>The tweet replied was by you i.e you can't block yourself</li>
</ul>

	Once you authorize the bot, your subsequent block requests will be processed immediately.</p>
